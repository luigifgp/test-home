# Getting Started Test-home React App (node -v 16.19.0)

This project is base on `react-TS` as a client that the depends on a server
base on `nestjs` that handle API request to Github.

the expectation from the client is to show commits from this project and also
from others users (if it is allow to show those commits).

##How to run: 

We have set on this app Docker repositories as docker images to make faster to 
build on local using:
 `docker-compose-yml` we have 2 repositories for each environments.
run:
```bash
#  docker compose up -d 
```

we also have these application on live using vercel.

Vercel is a serverless platform that allow us for easy and faster deployments for static sites, 
built to integrate with your headless content, commerce, or database.

Also Vercel allow us to deploy our server NESTJS app:

##How to run without Docker

## How to run without docker

this required the following environment variables:

```bash
REACT_APP_API= /* Api-Link */
REACT_APP_API_KEY= /* 'X-API-KEY' to protected the server API (It could be only anything of you choice) */
```

Please remember to use the `.env.example` file that we have in our dir folder
rename this file deleting ".example".

(only if we also wish to run our server on local)
we need to change this environment variable on the client to a localhost i.e. `http://localhost:4000/`:

```bash
REACT_APP_API=
```

Use following command with node -v 16.19.0:

## pnpm install

## pnpm start
